In React Router Dom v6, if you are using nested routes and have a route defined like this: `<Route path="/dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />` along with other routes, this can cause unexpected behavior. When navigating to any subroute of `/dashboard`, like `/dashboard/settings`, the wildcard `*` will always match, causing the `Dashboard` component to render regardless of the specific subroute.  This means that route parameters might not work as expected for nested routes under `/dashboard`. For example, if you intend to have a route `/dashboard/:id`, it will be overshadowed by the wildcard.
