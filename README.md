This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom v6 where a wildcard route ('/*') masks nested routes, leading to unexpected behavior and parameter issues. The bug occurs when a wildcard route is defined alongside nested routes. The wildcard route will always match, preventing the correct rendering of the nested routes and their respective parameters. The solution involves replacing the wildcard route with more specific route definitions, ensuring each nested route is explicitly defined to correctly handle parameter passing and route matching.
